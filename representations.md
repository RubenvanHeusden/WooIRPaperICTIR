# Stream representations

As mentioned in the paper, there are several different ways of representing a stream of documents. Below is a short explanation of the
ones used in the code of this paper. 

The following representation formats will be discussed:
 - Length List Format
 - Binary Format
 - Set Format


## Length List Format

This format represents a streams as the list of the document lengths of the individual documents. As en example, we can have a stream of 10 pages, with documents
of sizes 5, 1, and 4. The stream will then be represented as a list of numbers, in this case [5, 1, 4].

## Binary Format

## Set Format
